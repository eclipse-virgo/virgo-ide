			After successful configuration of an instance of the Virgo Tomcat Server in Eclipse you can use
			the Repository Browser to very easily install bundles and libraries from the remote
			SpringSource Enterprise Bundle Repository.
		</p><p>
			To open the Repository Browser double-click a Virgo Tomcat Server instance in the Servers
			view and select the "Repository" tab in the server editor. Please note that opening of the
			Editor may take a few seconds as the contents of the local repository needs to be indexed
			before opening.

			The left section of the Repository Browser allows the user to run searches against the
			SpringSource Enterprise Bundle Repository and displays matching results. The search can
			take parts of bundle symbolic names, class or package names and allows wildcards such as
			&lsquo;?&rsquo; and &lsquo;*&rsquo;. By selecting the checkbox left to a matching bundle and/or library and clicking
			the "Download" button it is	very easy to install new bundles in the Virgo Tomcat Server. For your
			convenience JARs containing the bundle source code can be automatically downloaded as well.
		</p><p>
			Clicking the "Download" button will trigger an Eclipse background job that will download
			the selected repository artifacts and -- if desired -- the source JARs one after another.
		</p><p>
			The section on the right displays the currently installed bundles and libraries. Bundles
			with available sources are visually marked. You can very easily download missing source
			JARs by using the "Install Sources" button.
