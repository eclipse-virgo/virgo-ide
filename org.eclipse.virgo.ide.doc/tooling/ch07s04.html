		The Virgo Server Editor includes a section to select when publishing to the server runtime should take place.
		The section offers three options: 
		</p><table summary="Simple list" border="0" class="simplelist"><tr><td>immediate publish on resource change</td></tr><tr><td>publish after build</td></tr><tr><td>never publish automatically</td></tr></table><p>
		Immediate publish means that a change to a file in a bundle project deployed on the Virgo Runtime Environment will be automatically published, triggering in most cases a
		re-deploy of the bundle project, as soon as the file is saved.
		Publish after build means that a change to one or more files will be automatically published, triggering in most cases a re-deploy, when the containing project
		is built, either because workspace auto-build is enabled or because the user requested a workspace or project build.
		Never publish automatically means that publishing will take place only on user request, via the "Publish" action on the Servers view.
		</p><p>
		While automatic publishing reduces the learning curve for beginners, it may also imply longer waits on large workspaces with many bundle projects deployed to a server, because
		the re-deploy of a project also implies the re-deploy of all dependent projects.
		On large workspaces it's recommend to turn off auto-publish and to manually publish bundles as needed. In fact, when the server is running in debug mode, 
		if a source file is changed without altering the external "signature" of a class the Java Virtual Machine will be able to push the new byte-code to the server without requiring
		a re-deploy of the containing bundle and dependencies. In such case the developer can simply save and build and the Java Virtual Machine will perform the hot-code replace.
		When the source code change affects the "signature" of a class (such as a change in the signature of a method, a change in inheritance, the addition/removal of new properties of methods)
		the Java Virtual Machine won't be able to perform the hot-code replace and in such case the user can manually invoke the publish action to trigger a re-deploy of the involved bundle.
