				While working with OSGi bundles, one of the most interesting and challenging aspects is defining
				the	package, bundle, and library imports in the manifest and then keeping this in sync
				with your compile classpath	either in Ant and Maven or Eclipse. In most cases you would typically
				be required to manually set up the Eclipse classpath. Ultimately, the Eclipse compile
				classpath is still different from the bundle runtime classpath, as normally an entire
				JAR file is being made available on the Eclipse classpath but not necessarily at runtime
				due to the explicit visibility rules defined in <code class="code">Import-Package</code> headers.
			</p><p>
				The Tools address this problem by providing an Eclipse classpath container that
				uses an Virgo Tomcat Server-specific dependency resolution mechanism. This classpath
				container makes resolved dependencies available on the project&rsquo;s classpath but allows
				only access to those package that are imported explicitly (e.g., via <code class="code">Import-Package</code>)
				or implicitly by using <code class="code">Import-Library</code> or <code class="code">Import-Bundle</code>.
			</p><p>
				To use the automatic dependency resolution, an OSGi bundle or PAR project needs to be
				targeted to a configured Virgo Tomcat Server instance. This can be done from the project&rsquo;s
				preferences by selecting the runtime on the "Targeted Runtimes" preference page.
			</p><p>
				</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
					In most scenarios it is sufficient to target the PAR project to a runtime. The nested
					bundles will then automatically inherit this setting.
				</div><p>
			</p><p>

			</p><p>
				After targeting the project or PAR you will see a "Bundle Dependencies" classpath
				container in your Java project. It is now safe to remove any manually configured classpath
				entries.
			</p><p>
				The classpath container will automatically attach Java source code to the classpath
				entries by looking for source JARs next to the binary JARs in the Virgo Tomcat Server&rsquo;s
				repository. You can also manually override the source code attachment by using the
				properties dialog on a single JAR entry. This manual attachment will always override
				the convention-based attachment.

				The Tools provide a Bundle Manifest Editor that assists the developer to create and
				edit MANIFEST.MF files. The editor understands the Virgo Tomcat Server specific headers
				like <code class="code">Import-Library</code> and <code class="code">Import-Bundle</code> and provides content
				assist features while editing source code. Furthermore a Eclipse Form-based UI is also
				available.
			</p><p>
				To open the Bundle Manifest Editor right click a MANIFEST.MF file and select "Bundle
				Manifest Editor" from the "Open With" menu.
			</p><p>
				</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
					Please note that the Virgo Tomcat Server specific manifest headers appear in green color
					to distinguish them from those headers defined in the OSGi specification. This also
					makes navigating much easier.
				</div><p>
			</p><p>
				<img src="images/tooling-manifest-source-editor.png">
			</p><p>
				The content assist proposals in the source tab as well as in the UI-based tabs are
				resolved from the bundle and library repository of an installed and configured
				Virgo Tomcat Server. Therefore it is important to target the project or PAR to a specific
				VTS instance to indicate to the tooling which bundle repository to use.
			</p><p>
				</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
					If a OSGi bundle project is not targeted to a VTS instance, either
					directory or indirectly via a PAR project&rsquo;s targetting, the manifest editor will not
					be able to provide content assist for importing packages, bundles, and libraries.

				The Dependencies tab of the Bundle Manifest Editor enables the user to easily download
				and install bundles and libraries from the SpringSource Enterprise Bundle Repository
				by using the "Download..." buttons next to the "Import Bundle" and "Import Library"
				sections.
