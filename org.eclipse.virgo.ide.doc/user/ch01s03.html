			Virgo Nano is a bit different than VK and VTS. 
			It is the smallest Virgo offering and takes performance to its limits, almost instantly booting up.
			Virgo Nano users will find a number of sections in this guide useful but sections that refer to
			<span class="emphasis"><em>plans, PARs and configuration deployment, regions, application scoping and libraries support</em></span> 
			are NOT relevant for Virgo Nano or VN and should be ignored.
			This Virgo distribution relies on p2 for its provisioning, therefore is bound to p2 concepts such as <span class="emphasis"><em>p2 features and update sites</em></span>.
			Note also that Virgo Nano includes Gemini.Web as its default web container implementation and uses its default configuration.
