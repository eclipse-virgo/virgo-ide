Each
		choice offers certain advantages, and it is important to understand those in order to make
		the right choice for your application. In this chapter, we take a closer look at the choices
		offered, compare them, and provide guidelines in choosing the right one based on your
		specific needs. </p><p> The VTS supports standard self-contained WAR files thus allowing you to
		use the Virgo Server for Apache Tomcat as an enhanced web server. The VTS also supports the
			<span class="emphasis"><em>Shared Libraries</em></span> WAR format which allows for slimmer WAR files that
		depend on OSGi bundles instead of including JAR files inside the WAR. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Shared
			Services</em></span> WAR format allows developers to further reduce the complexity of
		standard WARs by deploying services and infrastructure bundles alongside the WAR. A shared
		services WAR will then consume the services published by those bundles. To complete the
		picture, the VTS supports the new OSGi-standard <span class="emphasis"><em>Web Application
		Bundle</em></span> deployment format for web applications that builds on the benefits
		provided by a shared services WAR. In addition to this, VTS provides
		additional conveniences for developing and deploying Spring MVC-based web applications. </p><p>For applications consisting of multiple bundles and web applications, plans and the PAR
		format are the primary deployment models that take advantage of OSGi capabilities. We will
		explore all of these formats and their suitability later in this guide.</p><div class="section" title="Supported Deployment Formats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="architecture-deployment-formats"></a>Supported Deployment Formats</h2></div></div></div><p> The Virgo Server for Apache Tomcat supports applications packaged in the following formats: </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html#architecture-raw-osgi-bundles" title="Raw OSGi Bundles">Raw OSGi Bundles</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html#architecture-wars" title="WAR Deployment Formats">Java EE WAR</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html#architecture-war-gemini" title="WARs and the Gemini Web Container">Web Application Bundles</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html#architecture-pars" title="PAR">PARs</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html#architecture-plans" title="Plans">Plans</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html#architecture-configurations" title="Configurations">Configurations</a></p></li></ol></div><p> When you deploy an application to the VTS, each deployment artifact
			(e.g., a single bundle, WAR, PAR, or plan) passes through a deployment pipeline. This
			deployment pipeline is responsible for processing applications of certain types (i.e.,
			application type). The 3.5.0 release of the VTS natively
			supports deployers analogous to each of the aforementioned packaging options. </p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a closer look now at each of the supported deployment and packaging
			options to explore which one is best suited to your application.</p><div class="section" title="Raw OSGi Bundles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="architecture-raw-osgi-bundles"></a>Raw OSGi Bundles</h3></div></div></div><p> At its core, the Virgo Server for Apache Tomcat is an OSGi container. Thus any OSGi-compliant
				bundle can be deployed directly on the VTS unmodified. You&rsquo;ll
				typically deploy an application as a single bundle or a set of stand-alone bundles
				if you&rsquo;d like to publish or consume services globally within the container via
				the OSGi Service Registry. </p></div><div class="section" title="WAR Deployment Formats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="architecture-wars"></a>WAR Deployment Formats</h3></div></div></div><p> For Web Application Archives (WAR), the Virgo Server for Apache Tomcat provides support for the
				following three formats. </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html#architecture-standard-war" title="Standard WAR">Standard WAR</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html#architecture-shared-libraries-war" title="Shared Libraries WAR">Shared Libraries
						WAR</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html#architecture-shared-services-war" title="Shared Services WAR">Shared Services
						WAR</a></p></li></ol></div><p> Each of these formats plays a distinct role in the incremental migration path
				from a standard Java EE WAR to an OSGi-ified web application.</p><div class="section" title="Standard WAR"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="architecture-standard-war"></a>Standard WAR</h4></div></div></div><p> Standard WAR files are supported directly in the VTS. At
					deployment time, the WAR file is transformed into an OSGi bundle and installed
					into Tomcat. All the standard WAR contracts are honoured, and your existing WAR
					files should just drop in and deploy without change. Support for standard,
					unmodified WAR files allows you to try out the Virgo Server for Apache Tomcat on your existing
					web applications and then gradually migrate toward the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shared
						Libraries WAR</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Shared Services WAR</em></span>
					formats. </p><p> In addition to the standard support for WARs that you would expect from
					Tomcat, the VTS also enables the following features:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Spring-driven load-time weaving (see Section 6.8.4, ???Load-time weaving
							with AspectJ in the Spring Framework").</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Diagnostic information such as FFDC (first failure data
						capture)</p></li></ol></div><p> The main benefit of this application style is familiarity -- developers know
					how to create a WAR file! You can take advantage of the
					VTS&rsquo;s added feature set without modifying the
					application. The application can also be deployed on other Servlet containers or
					Java EE application servers.</p><p> You may choose this application style if the application is fairly simple and
					small. You may also prefer this style even for large and complex applications as
					a starting point and migrate to the other styles over time as discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Migrating to OSGi">Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;<i>Migrating to OSGi</i></a> . </p></div><div class="section" title="Shared Libraries WAR"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="architecture-shared-libraries-war"></a>Shared Libraries WAR</h4></div></div></div><p> If you have experience with developing and packaging web applications using
					the standard WAR format, you&rsquo;re certainly familiar with the pains of
					library bloat. So, unless you&rsquo;re installing shared libraries in a common
					library folder for your Servlet container, you have to pack all JARs required by
					your web application in <code class="literal">/WEB-INF/lib</code>. Prior to the release of
					the Virgo Server for Apache Tomcat, such library bloat has essentially been the norm for web
					applications, but now there is a better solution! The Shared Libraries WAR
					format reduces your application&rsquo;s deployment footprint and eradicates
					library bloat by allowing you to declare dependencies on libraries via standard
					OSGi manifest headers such as <code class="literal">Import-Package</code> and <code class="literal">Require-Bundle</code> . The VTS provides additional
					support for simplifying dependency management via the <code class="literal">Import-Library</code> and <code class="literal">Import-Bundle</code> manifest headers
					which are essentially macros that get expanded into OSGi-compliant <code class="literal">Import-Package</code> statements. </p><div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p> For detailed information on which libraries are already available, check
						out the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.springsource.com/repository" target="_top">SpringSource Enterprise Bundle Repository </a> .
					</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Shared Services WAR"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="architecture-shared-services-war"></a>Shared Services WAR</h4></div></div></div><p> Once you&rsquo;ve begun taking advantage of declarative dependency management
					with a Shared Libraries WAR, you&rsquo;ll likely find yourself wanting to take
					the next step toward reaping further benefits of an OSGi container: sharing
					services between your OSGi-compliant bundles and your web applications. By
					building on the power and simplicity of Spring-DM, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Shared Services
						WAR</em></span> format puts the OSGi Service Registry at your finger tips. As
					a best practice you&rsquo;ll typically publish services from your domain,
					service, and infrastructure bundles via <code class="literal">&lt;osgi:service ...
					/&gt;</code> and then consume them in your web application&rsquo;s
					ApplicationContext via <code class="literal">&lt;osgi:reference ... /&gt;</code>. Doing so
					promotes programming to interfaces and allows you to completely decouple your
					web-specific deployment artifacts from your domain model, service layer, etc.,
					and that&rsquo;s certainly a step in the right direction. Of the three supported
					WAR deployment formats, the Shared Services WAR is by far the most attractive in
					terms of modularity and reduced overall footprint of your web applications.

					Virgo Server for Apache Tomcat fully supports the OSGi Web Applications standard. Using the
					reference implementation from Gemini Web that was developed by SpringSource from
					an offshoot of the original VTS codebase. This RI is now fully
					integrated in VTS as the basis of the support for web
					application deployment. 
				</p><p> 
					The OSGi Web Applications specification introduces the concept of a <span class="emphasis"><em>Web
					Application Bundle</em></span>, which is a WAR that is also a bundle. The
					specification defines how WAR files are transformed into bundles automatically
					as needed. 
				</p><p>

						allow you to construct sophisticated applications. The table below 
						summarises the extensions that are available or in development. </p><div class="table"><a name="N10291"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;3.1.&nbsp;</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Instrumentable ClassLoaders</td><td>All web bundle ClassLoaders are instrumentable by

				(e.g., service, domain, and infrastructure bundles as well as a WAR or web module
				for web applications) in a single deployment unit. This allows you to deploy,
				refresh, and undeploy your entire application as a single entity. If you are
				familiar with Java EE, it is worth noting that a PAR can be considered a replacement
				for an EAR (Enterprise Archive) within the context of an OSGi container. As an added
				bonus, modules within a PAR can be refreshed independently and on-the-fly, for
				example via the Virgo Eclipse IDE Tooling (see the Virgo Tools Guide). </p><p> Many of the benefits of the PAR format are due to the underlying OSGi
				infrastructure, including: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p> Fundamentally modularized applications: instead of relying on fuzzy
							boundaries between logical modules in a monolithic application, this
							style promotes physically separated modules in the form of OSGi bundles.
							Then each module may be developed separately, promoting parallel
							development and loose coupling.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p> Robust versioning of various modules: the versioning capability
							offered by OSGi is much more comprehensive than alternatives. Each
							module can specify a version range for each of its dependencies. Bundles
							are isolated from each other in such a way that multiple versions of a
							bundle may be used simultaneously in an application.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p> Improved manageability: each bundle may be deployed or undeployed in
							a running application. This allows modifying the existing application to
							fix bugs, improve performance, and even to add new features without
							having to restart the application.</p></li></ul></div><p> Furthermore, PARs scope the bundles of your application within the
				VTS. Scoping provides both a physical and logical application
				boundary, effectively shielding the internals of your application from other PARs
				deployed within the VTS. This means your application doesn&rsquo;t
				have to worry about clashing with other running applications (e.g., in the OSGi
				Service Registry). You get support for load-time weaving, classpath scanning,
				context class loading, etc., and the VTS does the heavy lifting for
				you to make all this work seamlessly in an OSGi environment. If you want to take
				full advantage of all that the Virgo Server for Apache Tomcat and OSGi have to offer, packaging and
				deploying your applications as a PAR is a good choice, although plans are an even
				better one, as described in the next section.</p><div class="tip" title="OSGi != multiple JARs" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">OSGi != multiple JARs</h3><p> Note that while physically separated modules can, in theory, be implemented
					simply using multiple JARs, complex versioning requirements often make this
					impractical. For example, consider the situation depicted in the diagram below. </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Bundle A depends on version 1.0.0 of bundle B and version 2.0.0 of
								bundle C.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Bundle B depends on version 1.0.0 of bundle C.</p></li></ul></div><p> Suppose that versions 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 of bundle C are neither
					backward nor forward compatible. Traditional monolithic applications cannot
					handle such situations: either bundle A or bundle B would need reworking which
					undermines truly independent development. OSGi&rsquo;s versioning scheme enables
					this scenario to be implemented in a robust manner. If it is desirable to rework
					the application to share a single version of C, then this can be planned in and
					is not forced. </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/architecture-bundle-versioning.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Plans"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="architecture-plans"></a>Plans</h3></div></div></div><p> A plan is similar to a PAR in that it encapsulates all of the artifacts of your
				application in a single deployment unit. The main difference, however, is that a
				plan is simply an XML file that lists the artifacts of your application; a PAR, by
				contrast, is an actual JAR file that physically contains the artifacts. Just like a
				PAR, you deploy, refresh, and undeploy a plan as a single entity. We highly
				recommends the use of plans for creating applications. </p><p> When you create a plan, you can specify that the included bundles and services
				are in a scope that isolates them from the rest of Virgo Server for Apache Tomcat and its
				deployments. This scoping ensures that the bundles wire to each other and see each
				other&rsquo;s services in preference to services from outside the scope. Scoping
				also prevents application code from leaking into the global scope or scope of
				another application. In addition, a plan can link the lifecycle of a group of
				bundles together atomically, which ensures that start, stop, and uninstall
				events on a single artifact in the plan are escalated to all artifacts in the plan.
				You can, however, disable both of these features by simply setting an attribute in
				the plan. </p><p> The general benefits of using plans are similar to those of using PARs; see <a class="link" href="ch03.html#architecture-pars" title="PAR">PAR</a> for details. Plans offer added benefits,
				however, such as the ability to control the deployment order of your application:
				the order in which you list artifacts in the plan&rsquo;s XML file is the order in
				which VTS deploys them. Additionally, because plans specify the
				artifacts that make up an application by reference, it is easier to share artifacts
				between plans as well as update individual parts of a plan without having to
				physically repackage (re-JAR) it. </p></div><div class="section" title="Configurations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="architecture-configurations"></a>Configurations</h3></div></div></div><p>A Configuration is simply a Java properties file. When deployed it will be
				recognised by the deployer and installed in to <span class="emphasis"><em>Configuration
				Admin</em></span> for later use by your applications. VTS supports
				both singleton (ManagedService) and factory (ManagedServiceFactory) configurations.
				(see section 104.6 in the Compendium Specification) </p><p>For a singleton configuration the name that it will be installed under is its filename 
				minus the <code class="code">.properties</code> extension. Factory Configuration is supported by

				be created by <span class="emphasis"><em>Configuration Admin</em></span> (see section 104.6 in the
