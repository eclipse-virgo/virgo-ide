	  	    The Virgo Tomcat Server, or VTS for short, is the runtime portion of the Virgo Server.
	        It is a lightweight, modular, OSGi-based runtime that provides a complete packaged solution for developing,
	        deploying, and managing enterprise applications. 
			By leveraging several best-of-breed technologies and improving upon
			them, the VTS offers a compelling solution to develop and deploy
			enterprise applications.

				The Virgo Tomcat Server is built on top of the following core technologies: 
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.springframework.org/" target="_top">Spring Framework</a>, obviously!</li><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_top">Tomcat</a> as the web container.</li><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.osgi.org/Specifications/HomePage" target="_top">OSGi R4.3</a>.</li><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/" target="_top">Equinox</a> as the OSGi implementation.</li><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.springframework.org/osgi/" target="_top">Spring Dynamic Modules for OSGi</a> for working with OSGi in a Spring application.</li><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.springsource.com/products/sts" target="_top">SpringSource Tool Suite</a> for developing applications.</li></ul></div><p>
				Note, however, that the Virgo Tomcat Server isn&rsquo;t just a combination
				of these technologies. Rather, it integrates and extends these
				technologies to provide many features essential for developing,
				deploying, and managing today&rsquo;s enterprise Java applications.

			The following diagram presents a high-level overview of the VTS&rsquo;s architecture. 
		</p><p>
			<img src="images/introduction-architecture.png">
		</p><p>
			At the heart of the Virgo Tomcat Server is the Virgo Kernel or VK. 
			The VK is an OSGi-based kernel that takes full advantage of the modularity 
			and versioning of the OSGi platform. The VK builds on a base version of Virgo Nano or VN and extends its capabilities for
			provisioning and library management, as well as providing core functionality for the VTS. The VN maintains a minimal 
			runtime footprint and startup time. It builds on top of a pure Equinox, extending it with more sophisticated diagnostics and supportability functionality. 
			The VN supports full p2 provisioning. This feature is not included in the Virgo Nano Base that the VK is built on.
		</p><p>
			To maintain a minimal runtime footprint, OSGi bundles are installed on demand by the
			VN. On subsequent restarts these core bundles are warm-started thus reducing the startup time. This allows for an application to be installed 
			into a running VTS and for its dependencies to be satisfied from an external repository. Not only
			does this remove the need to manually install all your application dependencies, which would be tedious, but it also keeps memory usage to a minimum.
		</p><p>
			As shown in the figure, VK runs on top of VN that extends Equinox within a standard Java
			Virtual Machine. Above the VK further layers contribute functionality
			to the VTS. Such as management and web application support.

			Version 1.0.0 of the Virgo Tomcat Server supports <span class="emphasis"><em>bundle</em></span>, 
			<span class="emphasis"><em>plan</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>PAR</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>configuration</em></span>,
			<span class="emphasis"><em>Web Application Bundle (WAB)</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>WAR</em></span> artifacts, which enable
			you to build sophisticated web applications. This includes support for
			standard Java EE WARs, "shared library" WARs, and "shared services" WARs, each of
			which will be covered in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Deployment Architecture">Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<i>Deployment Architecture</i></a>.

			The Virgo Nano has a different provisioning system which isn't included in the Virgo Nano Base on which the 
			VK and the VTS are built.
		</p><p>
			Version 1.0.0 of the Virgo Nano supports <span class="emphasis"><em>bundle</em></span>, 
			<span class="emphasis"><em>p2 feature</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Web Application Bundle (WAB)</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>WAR</em></span> artifacts, which enable
			you to build sophisticated web applications too, taking full advantage of p2's dependency resolution, automated download and fail-early mechanics.
			The Virgo Nano does NOT support <span class="emphasis"><em>plan</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>PAR</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>configuration</em></span> artifacts.
			New <span class="emphasis"><em>features</em></span> are provisioned via <span class="emphasis"><em>update sites</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>p2 repositories</em></span>.
			Brief overview of p2 and it's mechanics is available on <a class="ulink" href="http://bkapukaranov.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/rt-meets-p2/" target="_top">this blog</a>.
			The VN's default web container implementation is Gemini Web.
