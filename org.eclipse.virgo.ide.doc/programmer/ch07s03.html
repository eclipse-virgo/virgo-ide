			When using a library that performs bytecode weaving or instrumentation, such as AspectJ,
			OpenJPA or EclipseLink, any types that are woven must be able to see the library doing
			the weaving. This is accomplished by adding an <code class="literal">Import-Library</code> for the
			weaving library into all bundles that are to be woven.
		</p><p>
			Weaving is often used by JPA implementations to transform persisted types. When using a
			JPA provider that uses load-time weaving, an <code class="literal">Import-Library</code> for the
			provider is needed in the bundles containing the persisted types.
