		Increasing complexity in modern enterprise applications is a fact of life.
		Developers not only have to deal with complex business logic, but also a myriad
		of other concerns such as security, auditing, exposing business
		functionality to external applications, and managing the evolution of
		these concerns. The Spring Framework addresses these 
		needs by offering a Plain-Old Java Object (POJO) based solution that 
		lets you focus on your business logic.

		Complex applications pose problems that go beyond using the right set of
		technologies. You need to take into account other considerations such as
		a simplified development process, easy deployment, monitoring deployed
		applications, and managing changes in response to changing business needs.
		This is where the Virgo Server comes into play. It offers a simple yet
		comprehensive platform to develop, deploy, and service enterprise
		applications. In this Programmer Guide, we explore the runtime portions of the
		Virgo Server, the Virgo Tomcat Server, Virgo Jetty Server and the 
		Virgo Kernel, and learn how to develop applications to benefit from their 
		capabilities.

			Although this guide is written primarily for Virgo Tomcat Server programmers, much of it is also useful for
			Virgo Kernel programmers who should simply ignore the web-related sections.

			This guide is written primarily for Virgo Tomcat Server programmers. Although a base version of Virgo Nano, without the new provisioning
			system, is used to build the Virgo Tomcat Server, much of this guide does not apply to Virgo Nano. The VN lacks regions support but has much
			improved runtime footprint and startup time and also provides support for p2 provisioning. The Virgo Nano features are covered better in the
